It is no secret that I love books.  Though I prefer the printed book, I also have electronic collections on every device imaginable.  
From speaking about the [WE SHOULD ALL BE FEMINISTS ](https://www.chimamanda.com/book/we-should-all-be-feminists/) or how 
[BOOKS MAKE A BETTER LIFE](https://www.skipprichard.com/books-make-a-better-life/) to visiting bookstores and libraries, I want 
to share this passion with you all through this Temple Library page, which is built with love and warmth. 

Charlie “Tremendous” Jones was one of great influencers. He repeatedly said that, “You will be the same person you are today in five years 
but for two things: the people you meet and the books you read.”

Books change lives
